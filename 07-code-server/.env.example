# 07-code-server/.env.example
# This file is for service-specific environment variable overrides or additions for the Codium stack.
# Variables set here will take precedence over those in the root ../.env file.
#
# Most variables (DEFAULT_PUID, DEFAULT_PGID, TZ, CODIUM_DOMAIN, CODIUM_CONFIG_DIR)
# are typically managed in the root ../.env file.

# Example: Overriding a global variable
# TZ=Asia/Tokyo

# Example: Setting the Codium-specific password if you chose to use it
# This would override any VSCODING_PASSWORD potentially set in the root .env,
# or provide it if it's only set here.
# VSCODING_PASSWORD=a_very_specific_password_for_this_codium_instance

# Example: If you wanted a different default workspace specifically for an instance defined here
# DEFAULT_WORKSPACE=/config/workspace/my_other_project

# The main variables for this stack (CODIUM_DOMAIN, CODIUM_CONFIG_DIR, PUID, PGID, TZ, optional VSCODING_PASSWORD)
# are expected to be set in the root ../.env file.
# This local .env is mostly for overrides or very specific instance settings.
