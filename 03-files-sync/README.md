# SyncThing Stack

## üí° Purpose

This stack deploys **SyncThing**, an open-source, continuous, and decentralized file synchronization application. It allows you to securely sync files directly between your devices (servers, laptops, phones) without relying on a central cloud server.

This configuration uses `network_mode: host` for potentially better peer discovery and NAT traversal. It also relies on **bind mounts** to link directly to configuration and data directories on your host machine.

The Web UI is typically exposed via a central reverse proxy (like Caddy).

## üì¶ Services Included

*   **`syncthing`**: The main SyncThing synchronization service and Web UI.

## Prerequisites

*   **Docker & Docker Compose:** Installed on your host system.
*   **Root `.env` File:** A configured `.env` file must exist in the parent directory (`../.env`) containing necessary PUID/PGID and TZ settings.
*   **Host Directories:** You **must** create specific directories on your host machine *before* starting the stack to store SyncThing's configuration and the data you intend to sync.
*   **(Optional) Shared Docker Network (`proxy_network`):** Only needed if you intend to expose the Web UI via Caddy (recommended). Caddy needs to be on this network, but SyncThing itself uses host networking.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1.  **Environment Variables (`../.env`):**
    *   The SyncThing service requires the following variables defined in the root `.env` file (`../.env`):
        *   `SYNCTHING_PUID`: The **User ID** of the user on your **host machine** that owns the configuration and data directories you will create below. Find using `id -u <your_username>`. **CRITICAL for correct permissions.**
        *   `SYNCTHING_PGID`: The **Group ID** of the user on your **host machine** that owns the configuration and data directories. Find using `id -g <your_username>`. **CRITICAL for correct permissions.**
        *   `TZ`: Sets the timezone for the container logs/timestamps.

2.  **Host Directories & Bind Mounts (CRITICAL):**
    *   SyncThing requires directories on your host system for its configuration and for the actual data folders it will manage.
    *   **Before starting**, create these directories relative to this stack's `docker-compose.yml` file (or specify absolute paths in the compose file if preferred):
        ```bash
        # Create the configuration directory
        mkdir -p ./syncthing_config

        # Create the main data directory SyncThing will manage internally
        # The compose file maps this to /var/syncthing/Sync inside the container
        mkdir -p ./syncthing_data
        ```
    *   **Ownership:** Ensure the user/group specified by `SYNCTHING_PUID`/`SYNCTHING_PGID` in your `.env` file **owns** these created directories (`./syncthing_config`, `./syncthing_data`). Use `chown` if necessary:
        ```bash
        # Example: chown 1000:1000 ./syncthing_config ./syncthing_data
        sudo chown ${SYNCTHING_PUID}:${SYNCTHING_PGID} ./syncthing_config ./syncthing_data
        ```
    *   **Compose File Mapping:** The `docker-compose.yml` maps these host directories into the container:
        ```yaml
        volumes:
          - ./syncthing_config:/var/syncthing/config # Host config -> Container config
          - ./syncthing_data:/var/syncthing/Sync   # Host data root -> Container data root
        ```
        *You can add more `- ./host/path:/var/syncthing/FolderName` lines if you want SyncThing to manage multiple distinct host directories.*

3.  **Networking (`network_mode: host`):**
    *   This configuration sets `network_mode: host` in `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   **Implications:**
        *   The SyncThing container shares the host's network stack directly.
        *   It binds directly to host ports: `8384` (Web UI), `22000` (TCP/UDP Sync), `21027` (UDP Discovery). Ensure these ports are free on your host.
        *   Firewall: You may need to open ports `22000` (TCP/UDP) and `21027` (UDP) on your host's firewall for external/WAN synchronization.
        *   **Caddy Proxying:** Because it binds directly to the host, your Caddy reverse proxy (running in a separate container on the `proxy_network`) **must** proxy to SyncThing using `localhost:8384` or `127.0.0.1:8384`, *not* the service name `syncthing`.

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Prepare Host:**
    *   Create the host directories (`./syncthing_config`, `./syncthing_data`) as described above.
    *   Set correct ownership for these directories.
    *   Ensure `SYNCTHING_PUID`/`SYNCTHING_PGID` are set correctly in `../.env`.

2.  **Start the Stack:**
    *   Navigate to this directory (`cd path/to/03-files-sync/`).
    *   Run: `docker-compose up -d`

3.  **Accessing SyncThing Web UI:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the domain configured for SyncThing in your Caddyfile (e.g., `https://sync.yourdomain.com`).
    *   **(First Run):** SyncThing may prompt you to set up authentication (username/password) for the Web UI. It's highly recommended to do this. Access `Settings` -> `GUI`.

4.  **Configuring SyncThing:**
    *   **Add Remote Devices:** Get the Device ID from SyncThing instances on your other computers/phones and add them via `Actions` -> `Show ID` and `Add Remote Device`.
    *   **Share Folders:**
        *   Click `Add Folder`.
        *   **Folder Path:** This path is *inside the container*. The default data volume (`./syncthing_data` on host) is mapped to `/var/syncthing/Sync` inside the container. If you want to sync the contents of `./syncthing_data` directly, use `/var/syncthing/Sync` as the Folder Path. If you created subdirectories inside `./syncthing_data` on the host (e.g., `./syncthing_data/Documents`), use `/var/syncthing/Sync/Documents` as the path inside SyncThing.
        *   Give the folder a Label (e.g., "My Documents").
        *   Go to the `Sharing` tab and select the remote devices you want to share this folder with.
        *   Accept the shared folder on your other devices.

5.  **Stopping the Stack:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

6.  **Viewing Logs:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f syncthing
    ```

## üíæ Data Persistence

*   **Configuration:** Stored directly on the host in the `./syncthing_config` directory (or the path you configured).
*   **Synced Data:** Stored directly on the host in the `./syncthing_data` directory (or other paths you explicitly mapped).
*   **Crucially, back up these host directories regularly!** Docker named volumes are not used for primary config/data in this setup.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Permission Denied Errors (in Logs or UI):**
    *   Almost always caused by incorrect ownership of the host directories (`./syncthing_config`, `./syncthing_data`).
    *   Verify the `SYNCTHING_PUID` and `SYNCTHING_PGID` in `.env` match the actual owner of these directories on the host (`ls -l`). Use `sudo chown PUID:PGID ...` to fix.
*   **Cannot Access Web UI:**
    *   Check Caddy logs. Is it proxying correctly to `localhost:8384`?
    *   Is SyncThing running (`docker ps`)? Check SyncThing logs (`docker-compose logs -f syncthing`).
    *   Is port `8384` blocked by a host firewall?
*   **Devices Not Connecting:**
    *   Check host firewall rules (allow ports `22000` TCP/UDP, `21027` UDP).
    *   Verify Device IDs are correct on both ends.
    *   Check SyncThing logs on both devices for connection errors.
    *   Ensure global discovery and relaying are enabled (in SyncThing settings) if needed for NAT traversal, or configure direct port forwarding on your router if possible.
