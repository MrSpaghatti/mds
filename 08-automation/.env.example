# 08-automation/.env.example
# This file is for service-specific environment variable overrides or additions for the Watchtower stack.
# Variables set here will take precedence over those in the root ../.env file.
#
# Key Watchtower variables (WATCHTOWER_POLL_INTERVAL, WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP, WATCHTOWER_LABEL_ENABLE)
# are typically managed in the root ../.env file for global update strategy.
# Notification settings would also usually be global.

# Example: Overriding global Watchtower poll interval for this specific instance (if you ran multiple Watchtowers)
# WATCHTOWER_POLL_INTERVAL=3600 # Check every hour, overriding global setting

# Example: Enabling label-only mode specifically for a Watchtower instance defined here
# WATCHTOWER_LABEL_ENABLE=true

# Most Watchtower settings like poll interval, cleanup, label enabling, and notification
# endpoints are best managed globally in the root ../.env file.
# Use this file if you have a very specific reason to override those for a particular
# Watchtower instance (though this stack currently only defines one).
