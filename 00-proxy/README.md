# Caddy Reverse Proxy Stack (with Cloudflare DNS)

## üìã Purpose

This stack deploys **Caddy v2**, a powerful, easy-to-use web server and reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS. This configuration is specifically set up to use the **Cloudflare DNS plugin**, allowing Caddy to obtain Let's Encrypt SSL certificates via the DNS-01 challenge method. This is essential for:

- Obtaining wildcard certificates (e.g., `*.yourdomain.com`).
- Getting certificates when your server is not directly reachable from the public internet on ports 80/443 (e.g., behind NAT without port forwarding).

Caddy acts as the single entry point for web traffic to your self-hosted services, routing requests to the appropriate backend containers based on hostname.

---

## üì¶ Services Included

- **`caddy`**: The Caddy v2 web server/reverse proxy.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose:** Installed on your host system.
- **Shared Docker Network (`proxy_network`):** This network must be created beforehand (`docker network create proxy_network`) as Caddy needs it to communicate with the backend services it proxies.
- **Root `.env` File:** A configured `.env` file must exist in the parent directory (`../.env`) containing necessary Cloudflare API credentials and your ACME registration email.
- **Cloudflare Account:** Your domain must be managed by Cloudflare.
- **Cloudflare API Token (for Caddy ACME):** You need a Cloudflare API token with permissions to **read zones** and **edit DNS records** for the specific zone(s) Caddy will manage certificates for.
  - Recommended permissions: `Zone:Read`, `DNS:Edit` for the relevant zone(s).
  - [Creating Cloudflare API Tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/create-token/).
  - **Note:** This token *might* be different from the one used by `ddclient` if you prefer more granular permissions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. Caddy Image with Cloudflare Plugin (CRITICAL)
- The standard `caddy:latest` or `caddy:<version>-alpine` images **do not** include the Cloudflare DNS plugin.
- You **must** edit this stack's `docker-compose.yml` to use an image that bundles the required plugin. A common choice is:
  ```yaml
  services:
    caddy:
      # Use an image built with the Cloudflare plugin
      # Check for specific version tags if preferred over latest
      image: ghcr.io/caddybuilds/caddy-cloudflare:latest
      # ... rest of the service definition
  ```
- Failure to use a compatible image will result in errors during certificate acquisition when using the DNS challenge.

### 2. Environment Variables (`../.env`)
- The Caddy service reads these variables from the root `.env` file:
  - `ACME_EMAIL`: Your email address for Let's Encrypt registration notifications.
  - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: The Cloudflare API token created specifically for Caddy's DNS challenges (with Zone:Read and DNS:Edit permissions). **Ensure the variable name here matches the one expected by the Caddy plugin image you use (usually `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).**
  - `TZ`: Sets the container timezone.

### 3. `Caddyfile` Configuration
- The primary Caddy configuration lives in the `Caddyfile` located **within this directory** (`./Caddyfile`).
- **You must edit this file** to define your domains and how they proxy to your backend services.
- **Global Options Block:** Ensure your `Caddyfile` includes a global options block to configure ACME email and the DNS challenge provider:
  ```caddyfile
  {
      # Your email from .env
      email {$ACME_EMAIL}

      # Use Let's Encrypt staging for testing (optional)
      # acme_ca https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

      # Enable Cloudflare DNS challenge using the token from .env
      acme_dns cloudflare {$CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
  }

  # --- Your Proxy Definitions Below ---

  your-service.yourdomain.com {
      # Proxy to a backend service running on the proxy_network
      reverse_proxy backend-service-container-name:backend-port
  }

  # Example for Syncthing if running in network_mode: host
  syncthing.yourdomain.com {
      # Proxy to localhost because it binds directly to the host port
      reverse_proxy localhost:8384
  }

  # ... other service definitions
  ```
- Refer to the [Caddyfile Documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile) for syntax and directives.

### 4. Networking
- The Caddy container is attached to the external `proxy_network`.
- It listens on host ports `80` and `443`.
- It communicates with backend services using their container names and ports *over the `proxy_network`* (unless the backend uses `network_mode: host`, in which case Caddy connects via `localhost:<port>`).

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Start the Stack**
   - Navigate to this directory:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/00-proxy/
     ```
   - Start the stack:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

2. **How It Works**
   - Once started, Caddy reads the `Caddyfile`.
   - For each domain defined, it attempts to acquire an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt using the Cloudflare DNS challenge (it temporarily creates TXT records in your Cloudflare zone using the API).
   - After obtaining certificates, Caddy listens for HTTPS traffic on port 443 (and redirects HTTP on port 80).
   - Incoming requests are matched against the domains in the `Caddyfile` and proxied to the appropriate backend service according to the `reverse_proxy` directives.

3. **Stopping the Stack**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

4. **Viewing Logs (Essential for Troubleshooting)**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f caddy
   ```
   *Look for messages about certificate acquisition, proxy errors, etc.*

## üíæ Data Persistence

- **`caddy_data`:** A Docker named volume storing acquired SSL certificates, OCSP staples, and other operational state. **Crucial for persistence.**
- **`caddy_config`:** A Docker named volume storing backups of Caddy's configuration.
- **`./Caddyfile`:** The primary configuration file is bind-mounted directly from the host into the container.

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Errors (Check Logs First!)
- **Incorrect API Token/Permissions:** Verify the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is correct and has the required `Zone:Read`, `DNS:Edit` permissions in Cloudflare for the relevant zone. Regenerate if needed.
- **Wrong Caddy Image:** Double-check you are using an image *with* the Cloudflare plugin built-in. The standard image will fail DNS challenges.
- **ACME CA Rate Limits:** If testing frequently, uncomment the `acme_ca` directive in `Caddyfile` to use Let's Encrypt's staging environment. Remove it for production certificates.
- **DNS Propagation:** Although usually fast with Cloudflare, allow a minute or two for DNS changes if issues persist immediately after startup.
- **Incorrect `acme_dns` Directive:** Ensure the directive in your `Caddyfile` global block is present and correct.

### 502 Bad Gateway Errors
- This means Caddy reached the network but could not connect successfully to the backend service specified in `reverse_proxy`.
  - **Is the backend service running?** (`docker ps`, check logs of the backend service).
  - **Is the backend service on the `proxy_network`?** (`docker network inspect proxy_network`).
  - **Is the hostname/port in `reverse_proxy` correct?** (e.g., `backend-container-name:backend-port`). Typos are common.
  - **If backend uses `network_mode: host`:** Did you use `localhost:<port>` in `reverse_proxy`?
