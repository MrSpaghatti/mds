# 00-proxy/.env.example
# This file is for service-specific environment variable overrides or additions for the proxy stack.
# Variables set here will take precedence over those in the root ../.env file.
#
# Most variables are typically managed in the root ../.env file.
# Only add variables here if you need to override a global setting specifically for
# Caddy or ddclient, or if there's a variable only relevant to this stack.

# Example: Overriding a global variable (less common, usually done for testing)
# TZ=America/Los_Angeles

# Example: A variable that might be specific to Caddy if not managed globally
# CADDY_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# ddclient itself is primarily configured by DDCLIENT_* variables in the root ../.env
# No typical overrides are needed here for ddclient unless you have a very specific scenario.
