# 06-notes/.env.example
# This file is for service-specific environment variable overrides or additions for the NextTrilium stack.
# Variables set here will take precedence over those in the root ../.env file.
#
# Most variables are typically managed in the root ../.env file.
# The TRILIUM_NOTES_DOMAIN and optionally TRILIUM_NOTES_DATA_DIR are primary examples
# managed in the root .env.

# Example: Overriding a global variable (less common)
# TZ=America/New_York

# Example: If Trilium itself had a container-specific env var not managed elsewhere
# TRILIUM_SOME_SPECIFIC_SETTING=some_value

# The main variables for this stack (TRILIUM_NOTES_DOMAIN, TRILIUM_NOTES_DATA_DIR, TZ)
# are expected to be set in the root ../.env file.
# This local .env is mostly a placeholder unless specific overrides are needed.
