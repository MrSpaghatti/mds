# 00-auth/.env.example
# This file is for service-specific environment variable overrides or additions for the Authelia stack.
# Variables set here will take precedence over those in the root ../.env file.
#
# Most Authelia configuration is done via its configuration.yml, which itself can use
# environment variables sourced from ../.env (like AUTHELIA_JWT_SECRET, DOMAIN_NAME).
#
# Add variables here only if you need to override a global setting specifically for
# the Authelia container, or for variables that might influence its startup
# environment if not covered by configuration.yml or the global .env.

# Example: Overriding a global variable (less common)
# TZ=Europe/Paris

# Authelia's primary variables like AUTHELIA_JWT_SECRET, AUTHELIA_DOMAIN, DOMAIN_NAME
# are expected to be in the root ../.env file as they are used by Authelia's configuration.yml
# and also potentially by Caddy for integration.
# No common stack-specific overrides are typical here unless for advanced debugging.
