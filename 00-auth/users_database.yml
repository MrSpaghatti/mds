# Users database for Authelia (/00-auth/users_database.yml)
#
# This file stores user credentials when using the file-based authentication backend.
# You MUST populate this file with at least one user for Authelia to function correctly.
#
# How to add a user:
# 1. Start the Authelia container: `docker-compose up -d authelia` (from the `00-auth` directory).
# 2. Execute the hash-password command in the running Authelia container:
#    `docker-compose exec authelia authelia hash-password 'yourChosenStrongPassword'`
#    (Replace 'yourChosenStrongPassword' with a strong password).
# 3. Copy the complete hashed password output (it will look something like:
#    `$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=1,p=4$RANDOM_SALT_STRING$ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD_HASH`).
# 4. Edit this file (`00-auth/users_database.yml`) and add the user entry as shown below.
#
# Example:
# users:
#   admin:
#     displayname: "Administrator"
#     # Paste the hashed password from step 3 here
#     password: "$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=1,p=4$bL4fTStY8M7N6Uv7XNFXzA$T.oN.UZHRv9g0G8gN/1ZtXjZq8EaJ0X2tjGtfAeVk/I"
#     email: admin@example.com
#     groups:
#       - admins
#       - users
#   # Add more users as needed
#   # anotheruser:
#   #   displayname: "Another User"
#   #   password: "PASTE_HASHED_PASSWORD_HERE"
#   #   email: anotheruser@example.com
#   #   groups:
#   #     - users

users: {} # Initialize with an empty users object. Add users above this line following the example.
# It is critical that this file is not empty and has the 'users:' key.
# If Authelia fails to start with "Unable to find users database file", ensure this file has content like:
# users:
#   # your users here
# And that it's correctly mounted in docker-compose.yml.
